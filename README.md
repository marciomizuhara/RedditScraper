# RedditScraper
This project is a Reddit scraper I built from scratch. So far it has only the option to download media (both image and video) from an entire subreddit, but the idea is to add more options gradually.

# How to use
* First you need to have a valid Reddit developer app. For more information access https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/ to create one if you don't have it.
* You will need to write down the CLIENT_ID, the CLIENT_SECRET from your app and the USER_AGENT from your web browser.
* It's supposed to be run on Windows, as other systems can raise path errors.
* Access main.py and provide your CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET and USER_AGENT. 
* Then run main.py, the terminal will prompt you for a download folder and a subreddit name.
